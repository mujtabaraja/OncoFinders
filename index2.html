   <h1>introducing <em>oncofinders!</em></h1>

     <b id="text">Cancer treatment in the United States of America is far more expensive for patients than almost anywhere else, with a national cost of about 200 million USD in 2020 that is projected to climb even higher over the next decade. One recent study finds that the monthly cost for adult Americans who have cancer or are caring for cancer patients averages between $180 and $2,600, compared to a range of USD $15-400 in Canada and USD $58-438 in Australia. In 2018, the National Cancer Institute reported that patients may have to spend up to $12,000 a year for a single drug — and recent drugs are the most costly, with newly-approved treatments pricing at as high as $30,000 a month. To make matters worse, as the total healthcare cost for cancer in the US increases drastically every year, insurance companies are requiring more and more of these expenses to be paid out-of-pocket by the patient.

    <b id="text">The cost of cancer treatment in America constitutes a serious financial burden for patients and their families. These difficulties are most apparent for those from lower socioeconomic backgrounds who struggle to pay high costs for treatment, are not sufficiently insured for such costs, or are unable to earn a stable income because of cancer-related health problems. Furthermore, cancer cost expenses also extend to immigrants who may have not been educated stemming from low-income households, who have not been exposed to proper education about medicaid. In America, cancer death rates are consistently higher in poorer counties compared to richer counties, with large differences occurring in relatively preventable types of cancer. Financial hardships due to cancer expenses disproportionately affect younger patients, people of color, and those without high-school diplomas, in addition to those at low or middle-income.

    <b id="text">OncoFinders, our project for ‘Hack to the Future,’ is specifically designed to help those disadvantaged when obtaining cancer treatment, especially patients stemming from low socioeconomic backgrounds without a proper education. The tool can allow anyone to quickly and easily find an oncologist near them that accepts their insurance and thus would be relatively affordable. OncoFinder allows users to find oncologists who accept Medicaid by simply entering their zip code or city. The code filters from a database of doctors. Our website also presents financial resources as well as background research on our topic.
